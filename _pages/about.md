<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science, focusing on Human-Computer Interaction and Ubiquitous Computing at Aarhus University, Denmark.

I received my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Technology from Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (HITSZ). During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a research assistant at the [ai{DEAL} Studio](https://anpengcheng.cn/about/), School of Design, Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), advised by [Dr. Pengcheng An](https://anpengcheng.cn/about/). I am currently a research intern at the [AI4SG Lab](https://www.ai4sg.org/) at the National University of Singapore (NUS), supervised by [Dr. Yi-Chieh Lee](https://www.yclee.net/), and previously interned at the [Interactive Matter Lab](https://interactivematterlab.org/index.html) at Aarhus University, supervised by [Dr. Michael Wessely](https://interactivematterlab.org/profile.html).

My research interests include human-computer interaction related to <span style="color:rgb(144,200,144)">**health**</span> and <span style="color:lightpink">**social computing**</span>. My passion lies in using AI technologies and/or wearable devices to enhance human well-being, aiming to improve people’s lives. Additionally, I am keen on analyzing information from online media/apps to understand how digital platforms reflect and influence specific communities.

I like engaging in interdisciplinary exchanges and collaborations with all fields. Feel free to email me if you are interested in **collaborating or discussing research ideas**. I look forward to generating thought-provoking discussions!
