<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science, focusing on Human-Computer Interaction and Ubiquitous Computing at Aarhus University, Denmark.

I graduated from the School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (HITSZ), with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a research assistant at the [ai{DEAL} Studio](https://anpengcheng.cn/about/), School of Design, Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), advised by [Dr. Pengcheng An](https://anpengcheng.cn/about/). My work primarily focused on Human-AI Interaction and Collaboration.

My research interests include human-computer interaction related to <span style="color:rgb(144,200,144)">**health**</span> and <span style="color:lightpink">**social computing**</span>. I am always passionate about applying computer technologies and algorithms to improve people’s health and well-being.

I like engaging in interdisciplinary exchanges and collaborations with all fields. Feel free to email me if you are interested in **collaborating or discussing research ideas**. I look forward to generating thought-provoking discussions!
